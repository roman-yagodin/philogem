This small round stone is the "Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon".

The Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text,
containing teachings of Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people.

The Circle is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out from one another,
depending on which branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings...

It is said that some zerths spend years poring over the combinations of the plates,
looking for new significance in the teaching.
