_Slow reading_ is the intentional reduction in the speed of reading,
carried out to increase comprehension or pleasure.

The concept appears to have originated in the study of philosophy and literature
as a technique to more fully comprehend and appreciate a complex text.

More recently, there has been increased interest in slow reading
as result of the _slow movement_.
