The conditions of a solitary bird are five:

The first,
that it flies to the highest point;

the second,
that it does not suffer for company,
not even of its own kind;

the third,
that it aims its beak to the skies;

the fourth,
that it does not have a definite color;

the fifth,
that it sings very softly.
