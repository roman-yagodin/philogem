The Philogem project combines (yes, in a strange way!) a lot of things.

You can think of it as a kind of blog,
a collection of important personal notes,
or just a game of words -

a field which you can play on, make your own,
and possibly even develop further
in a ways that you (and only you)
would like, understand and know.

I'm trying to keep the base simple,
but hopefully not too stupid ;-)
