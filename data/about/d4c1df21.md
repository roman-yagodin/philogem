The Philogem project combines (in a strange way) a lot of things which is dear to me: WWW, programming, FLOSS, computer games, languages, philosophy, poetry, self-knowledge, humor, etc.

You can think of it as a blog, a collection of personal notes, a game of words - that you can play with, then make your own, and then develop further in a ways that you (and probably only you) would know, understand and love.

I'm trying to keep it simple, but hopefully not too stupid :)
