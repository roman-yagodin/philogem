The Philogem project combines (in a strange way)
a lot of things which is dear to me:
programming, WWW, FLOSS, computer games,
languages, philosophy, self-knowledge,
poetry, humor, etc, etc...

You can think of it as a kind of blog,
a collection of important personal notes,
or just a game of words -

which you can play with, make your own,
and possibly even develop further
in a ways that you (and only you)
would know, understand and love.

I'm trying to keep it very simple,
but hopefully not too stupid ;-)
