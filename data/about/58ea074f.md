The main (and only) resource in Protogame is the _action points_ (AP).

Action points recieved semi-randomly on a daily basis and could be spent to "follow" actions (costs 2 AP) and other actions (costs 1 AP).

When player AP counter reaches 0, he/she will no longer perform any actions in game and should wait at least 12h to recieve more AP in order to continue.
