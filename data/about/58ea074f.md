The main (and only) resource in Philogem is _action points_ (AP).

Action points are awarded for performing certain in-game actions.

When a player's AP counter reaches 8, he/she cannot perform any actions in game
and should wait until the AP counter decreases.

Action points degrade at a rate of 1 AP per 2 hours of real time.
This simulates AP spending.
